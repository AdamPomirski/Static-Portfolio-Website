				<p>Hi, I'm Adam Pomirski, a Software Engineer for Aviva.</p>
				<p>At Aviva, I work as a software engineer specializing in Guidewire ClaimCenter, a core insurance platform for managing claims processes. My role involves configuring, maintaining, and enhancing ClaimCenter to streamline the claims lifecycle, from first notice of loss (FNOL) to settlement. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I ensure the platform operates efficiently and meets the evolving needs of the business while delivering a seamless experience for our claims handlers and customers.</p>
				<p>A significant part of my work revolves around Guidewire Studio, an integrated development environment designed for Guidewire applications. Using this powerful tool, I develop and customize features within ClaimCenter, tailoring the system to align with Aviva's specific operational requirements. This involves writing code in Gosu (Guidewire’s programming language), creating and modifying policy rules, and implementing workflows that improve claim-processing efficiency. I also leverage Guidewire Studio to troubleshoot issues, test new configurations, and ensure system reliability.</p>
				<p>At Aviva, we use Jira to manage our software development lifecycle and stay aligned with agile methodologies. Jira allows our team to track tasks, prioritize features, and manage sprints effectively. I participate in sprint planning meetings, where we break down complex projects into manageable tasks, assign them to team members, and set achievable timelines. By logging progress and updating Jira tickets, I help ensure transparency across the team and enable stakeholders to stay informed about project milestones.</p>
				<p>Effective communication is critical in my role, and Microsoft Teams plays a pivotal role in fostering collaboration across departments. Whether it’s conducting daily stand-ups, discussing project updates, or troubleshooting issues in real-time, Teams enables us to stay connected and work cohesively. The platform also facilitates knowledge sharing through document collaboration and channel-based discussions, ensuring that everyone has access to the resources and expertise they need to succeed.</p>
				<p>In my role at Aviva, I contribute to improving customer outcomes by optimizing the ClaimCenter platform. By implementing automated processes, streamlining workflows, and ensuring compliance with industry standards, I help create a robust and efficient claims management system. My work not only enhances the productivity of claims handlers but also ensures that Aviva can deliver quick and fair resolutions to customers, reinforcing its reputation as a leading insurer.
